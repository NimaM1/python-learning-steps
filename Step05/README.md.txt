A beginner password manager that stores website login credentials in a JSON file.

It includes:

View all saved accounts (password partially hidden)

Search for a site and verify with a random security number before showing full password

Update username or password after verifying old values

Delete saved login information

This project teaches JSON data storage, input validation, loops, search functionality, and basic security concepts (masking passwords, simple verification).
