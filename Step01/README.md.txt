Contact Book – Python Beginner Project

This is a simple command-line contact book application.
It allows the user to:

Add a new contact

View all saved contacts

Search for a contact by name

Delete a contact

Exit the program

The data is stored temporarily in a dictionary during runtime.
This project helps beginners practice loops, conditionals, functions, and dictionary handling in Python.
